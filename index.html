				<p id="intro">There are many things that wander through your head when you have nothing to do and nowhere to go. That's the position I found myself in during quarantine in March of 2020. I was furhloghed from work and everything was shut down. My fiance and I immediately stocked up on groceries and behaved as if we were on vacation. Whipee!!!!</p>

					<h2>FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS</h2>
                    <p>After weeks of eating, making our own movies, eating, binge watching shows, eating....you see where this is heading, I turned on YouTube and that's when the light bulb in my head went off. I began watching videos on how to do many different things but landed on floral arrangements and resin art. I watched countless hours of diy floral arranging techniques as well as bouquets. After a few trips to the Dollar Tree and Walmart, I began making floral arrangements in the vases and pots I already had at home. I also went to a hobby store and bought some resin to use as faux water in my vases. Here are a few pictures of my very first floral arrangements done with faux flowers.</p>

					<h2>BOUQUETS</h2>
					<p>I stumbled into making bouquets because of pictures I posted of the floral arrangements I'd done. There's a lot of pressure doing bouquets, especially for a wedding because they have to be perfect. And of course my first one was for a wedding with live flowers. I had absolutley no experience working with live flowers, but I rolled up my sleeves and accepted the job. The bride was very pleased with my work and told me that it was exactly how she wanted it! I was elated at my accomplishment and shed a tear as I watched her walk down the aisle. Here's a picture of the bouquet and the boutennaire.</p>

					<h2>RESIN ART</h2>
					<p>As I began to research different types of resin to use for floral arrangements, I saw several videos on resin art and decided to take a look. I soon discovered that this was a rabbit hole that I could not escape. There's so many different things you can do artisticly with resin. I purchased some resin and molds, and began my journey into the world of resin art. I now own hundreds of molds and have created more things than I know what to do with. I began showing off my creations online which turned into people making orders to purchase my art. Here are some pictures of a few of my pieces.</p>
